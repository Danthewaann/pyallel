# pyallel

Run and handle the output of multiple executables in pyallel (as in parallel)

## TODOs

- [ ] Allow list of files to be provided to supply as input arguments to each command
- [ ] Allow input to be piped into `pyallel` via stdin to supply as standard input to each
      command
- [ ] Add custom config file for `pyallel` to read from as an alternative to providing
      arguments via the command line
